/**
 * Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Given nums = [1,1,2],
 * <p>
 * Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
 * <p>
 * It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
 * <p>
 * Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
 * <p>
 * It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
 * </p>
